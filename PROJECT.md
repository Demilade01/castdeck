Project Name: CastDeck

Description:
CastDeck is an open-source scheduling and draft management tool for Farcaster. It helps creators plan their content flow by writing, saving, and scheduling casts for future posting. The app uses Farcaster QuickAuth for authentication and connects to the Farcaster Hub API to publish scheduled casts at the right time.

Key Features:

Draft Manager: Write casts and save them as drafts.

Scheduling: Pick a date/time for a cast to be automatically posted.

Recurring Posts: Option to repeat daily/weekly (future enhancement).

Local & Cloud Storage: Drafts saved locally first, optional sync with server DB.

Simple UI: Minimal dashboard built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS.

Open Source: Built in TypeScript, MIT-licensed, open for community contributions.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js (Express or Next API routes) + Cron jobs (e.g., node-cron)

Auth: Farcaster QuickAuth

Database: SQLite (lightweight, optional) or Supabase for cloud storage

Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + small Node server (scheduler)

User Flow:

User signs in with Farcaster QuickAuth.

User writes a new cast â†’ saves as draft or schedules it.

Drafts are shown in a list with edit/delete options.
